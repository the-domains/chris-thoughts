# \#1 root cause of startup failure

## Choosing the right partners

Brother, sister, dad, mom: avoid. You don't want to yell at each other for business. They won't ever be completely honest with you, especially if they think your idea sucks. Just as you'll probably be very supportive of their initiative. In-laws too: avoid.

The guy who believes he is a god, the super-pop guy of your high school, the guy who will ultimately do nothing for you but drain your energy and cash out. Superstars out!

BFF or just a good friend of yours? If he is not super-competent in a critical domain for your venture, don't. Instead keep him as a good friend.

## It takes time!

Choosing the right partners takes time and is often very complicated. You're in a rush. You need someone NOW. Those are the worst reasons for recruiting the guy next door. Taking your time is no waste. Think about how much energy and money you'll waste solving your partnership issues later if you got it wrong.

Go ONLY for the  
_- _**super-competent** in the field of your interest - other competencies are nice to have but should not dismiss a weakness in the field of your interest -  
- **available**, i.e. willing to invest time in your venture. You should make sure that they truly are committed to your venture. There are many_yes-I'm-in_guys out there...  
- **hard working and willing to share the full burden with the team**, i.e. also take their share of boring work. On top of that, willing to distribute the shares of the venture according to their contribution rather than a pre-defined percentage (every potential team member should read_Slicing Pie_ by Mike Moyer before joining the team, and sign a Grunt Fund Agreement).  
- **complementary**. That is the toughest one, as we all tend to like people like us. Diversity is critical. Even if they say it is, large corporations tend to hire and grow clones. In a startup, you don't have any choice. You need all kind of competencies from procurement to human resources in your team.

And one very important thing to remember: **CHOOSE ALL YOUR PARTNERS THIS WAY**, not only the founders but also employees and investors. They must bring much more than workforce or cash to your venture.
