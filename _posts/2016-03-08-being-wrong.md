EXTRAORDINARY! If you just want to read one book this is the one. Personally I realised how ridiculous I was in being certain, and in some cases, in faking being certain. Being wrong is being human. Kathryn Schulz decorticates wrongness in a right way.

My rating: 4.7 (out of 5.0)

My category: Self-awareness
