This is my initiation business book. By that, I mean that after that I read many many business books. So. Thanks Edgar. I owe you that.

The book is about how hard it is to change culture and how to do it. At least how to try. Culture develops when a group of people start working together. People start taking the leader as example and a set of beliefs develops. Leading by example is key and often the only generator of culture. But all you gonna see are its artifacts.
