# Being too much - or not enough - of you!

## \#4 mistake leading to start-up failure

Well, that's tough to say. I'm my worst enemy. You are your worst enemy too.

- Did You fall in love with you own idea? Do you believe your customers don't understand how great your product/service is? I bet your startup will die soon.  
- If you don't accept that an idea is worth nothing without outstanding execution and that your very first partners should be fairly rewarded, your startup is doomed to fail.  
- Do you want everything completed as you would exactly do? Big are the chances that your partners already hate you.  
- So you expect others to work 24/7, as you are doing? You have no right to require that. And you are stupid to believe that it is what it takes to succeed.  
- Do you consider your startup as your son/daughter? Enjoy the teenager phase then ;-)

Take a deep breath. Open your eyes. And watch. You are not alone on an island. Your partners, employees, investors -- even your family -- is out there to support you in their way. In return, they earn the right to be respected by you and to have a life. Get help. Get one mentor or two. Get a coach!
