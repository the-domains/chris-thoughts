Close to a bible, if you see what I mean. Full of excellent tips and much more. This book got me. It triggered a need for change in my life. Although, we should all must acknowledge it: Tim is overly talented. Take a look at [his blog][0] if you want to learn even more.

My rating: 4.7 (out of 5.0)

My categories: Skills, Self-awareness
