# A recipe for staying focused

Yesterday, I was visiting a former colleague and explaining what the days of my new life were made of. Some DIY at home, which I should have done years ago but didn't by lack of time and energy. Kids. Demanding... very demanding. And the startups I'm developing in their respective stages.

My former boss -- whose opinion count a lot to me -- commented that I should pay attention and stay focused.

At first, I felt guilty and a bit ashamed. Fear came up too. Fear of failing at all these things I'm doing and I'm having great fun doing!

I thought a lot about what staying focus could mean. Just to realise that doing different things doesn't mean that you cannot stay focused on each of them at a time.

It looks like I have four different jobs. Of course, it takes time. But when I think about my previous position, it wasn't that different. Well, I only had one job. And one could think that I was focused. But truth is that I was in charge of many different things: leading a team, managing a project team and the project, following upon several other projects, developing innovation in the company with my colleagues, speaking at least once a month at a conference/event/workshop/seminar/webinar... and meeting a lot.

How to stay focused then? Some HR people will tell that it is the reason management by objectives has been invented.

With my four tasks, I would be less focused and incapable of defining proper objectives. To state one of the reasons I can focus much more: no never-ending meetings anymore.

Take all my former colleagues. They are in the same situation even if they have one job. Do they manage only one thing? I doubt. Do they stay focused? And I truly don't think it is very different in other companies. But you know that better than I do. People in large corporations aren't focused on only one job, they are focused on several tasks.

You now wonder what my recipe for staying focused is, don't you?

## My practical recipe

Beyond the three usual suspects (do creative work first; allocate your time deliberately; train your mind like a muscle):

* Keep 99% of the crap away.
* Only do what you are the best at and what you are having pleasure at.
* And don't fear! It kills pleasure and creativity. Failure is an opportunity, no matter what.
