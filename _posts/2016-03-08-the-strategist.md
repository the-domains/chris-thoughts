What does your company bring to the world?  
Does that difference matter?   
Is something about it scarce and difficult to imitate?   
Are you doing to day what you need to do in order to matter tomorrow? 

If you can clearly answer these questions, you are on the right track as a strategist. If not and if you wonder how to answer these, you will love this book.

My rating: 4.8 (out of 5.0)
