# Defuse the Energy Future

## Uncertain. There is no other word for it!

Touch job!

A debate about it took place in UCL, co-organised by Elia.

Here are the recommendations that emerged from this debate to make a step forward in the right direction.

1\. Improving Energy Efficiency means changing, adapting our way of living to decrease our energy consumption. To do that, we need to get the right incentives rather than get the incentives right (to paraphrase a common statement about doing things), for people to get high adoption and for companies to develop new products/services. Regulators and governments, do your job!

2\. The Future of Grid seems uncertain as Super-grid champions, Smart-grid champions and Micro-grid champions oppose rather than work hand in hand to develop an integrated solution. We need a Super-Smart-Micro-grid sooner than later. TSOs, DSOs, aggregators, etc, work together for once!

3\. Technically, anything is possible - economical, we are still in trouble \[Editor's note: and long will be\]. The current market design is far from being sufficient to enable our Energy Future: fair competition wanted! All parties, including RES developper, forget about your current position and start negotiating in a proper way, i.e. by maximising the size of the pie instead of your own slice only.

The complete summary of the debate can be found [here][0].
