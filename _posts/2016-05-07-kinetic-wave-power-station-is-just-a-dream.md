# Kinetic Wave Power Station is just a dream

## No business case any time soon in my opinion

Is it technically feasible? Yes, it is.

Is it technically exciting? Sure, it is.

Is it the way forward? NO, it's not because that's an overly expensive source of energy that is not only variable (intermittent) but also placed at the very end of the merit order (where the LONG TERM marginal cost sucks). Same as off-shore wind turbine with too heavy costs for foundations, installations and grid connections.

The complete simplistic business case can be found [here][0].
