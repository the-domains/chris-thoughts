# Tough job!A debate took place in UCL co-organised by Elia. Here are recommendations to make a step forward in achieving that goal.

* Improving Energy Efficiency means changing/adapting our way of living to decrease our energy consumption. To do that, we need to get the right incentives rather than get the incentives right (to paraphrase a common statement about doing things), for people to get high adoption and for companies to develop new products/services.
* The Future of Grid seems uncertain as Super-grid champions, Smart-grid champions and Micro-grid champions oppose rather than work hand in hand to develop an integrated solution. We need a Super-Smart-Micro-grid sooner than later.
* Technically, anything is possible - economical, we are still in trouble \[Editor's note: and long will be\]. The current market design is far from being sufficient to enable our Energy Future: fair competition wanted!The complete summary of the debate [here][0].
