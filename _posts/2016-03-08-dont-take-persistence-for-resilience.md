# Don't take persistence for resilience

## \#2 mistake leading to start-up failure

Business plan, business model... are tools to help you think about everything you need to. They are no end per se, just a mean. The only judge of your product/service is the customer. 

To convince a customer, you need a unique value proposition to distinguish your product/service from the crowd. Make sure you communicate it in a compelling manner.

NEVER fall in love with your idea. The customers should. Don't waste hours making a plan that you'll never complete. Just remember that the only thing we know about a plan is that it is the only thing that will never happen as such. Instead, get out to sell your product/service even before you have it. Make sure your first customers understand that what you are doing is great, and they will buy it in advance. They will finance your venture in doing so. Just as Microsoft, Dell, eBay, Zara, Netflix and many others did (read_The Customer-funded Business_ by John Mullins). 

Avoid dilution from the start! And make a product/service that fits customers need.
