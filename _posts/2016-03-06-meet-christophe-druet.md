# Meet Christophe Druet

ChristopheDruet is a beloved thought leader in the areas of electrical power systems, electricity markets, and innovation management. After almost 2 decades of continuous luck and success, he met career adversity. Very recently. He overcame this by finding his own path and true passion, and by changing career pretty drastically.

Beyond business, Christophe's greatest joys are spending time with his family and friends as well as helping inspire and educate others on how to improve their own careers. Christophe is praised for his authentic leadership style and business principles. His personal mission is pretty simple, yet so ambitious that you may find him delusional: he wants to [make a true difference in people's life][0].

Presently, Christophe enjoys focusing on reading and writing, growing startups and coaching entrepreneurs, and consulting in his fields of expertise every now and then.

His superpower is creating better solutions by linking and integrating seemingly disparate things within and across various fields.

That, and he makes a kickass honey-[_petit beurre_][1] ice-cream.
