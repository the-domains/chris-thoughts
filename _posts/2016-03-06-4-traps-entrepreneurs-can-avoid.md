9 startups out of 10 fails. According to stats in the US, 50% companies don't last more than 5 years. In Europe, from Eurostar data, one gets a failure rate of 25-33% within the 2 first years. Why such a discrepancy? Well, not all startups get incorporated. Many aborts even before reaching that point.

Why such a discrepancy? Well, not all startups get incorporated. Many aborts even before reaching that point.

Worrying.

The good news is that the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and kicking even in Europe with 10% new companies every single year.Wow2000000+ new companies. Annually. So much more, as aborted startups before incorporation are not accounted for in the stats.

Why do so many of them fail?

Cash is the most commonly cited issue you'll get. But as Jerry Colonna so well say most cash issue come from deeper issues. Here are 4 root causes that contribute to startup failures. Heavily.

## Choosing the wrong/Bad partners

****

* Brother, sister, dad, mom: avoid. You don't want to yell at each other for business. They won't ever be completely honest with you, especially if they think your idea sucks. Just as you'll probably be very supportive of their initiative. So NEXT.
* In-laws: NEXT too.
* The superstar: the guy who believes he is a god, the super-pop guy of your high school, the guy who will ultimately do nothing for you but drain your energy and cash out. NEXT too.
* A good friend of yours: is he super-competent? If not, NEXT. Keep him as a friend.

Choosing partners takes time and is often very complicated. You're in a rush. You need someone NOW. That's the worst reason for recruiting the guy. Taking your time is no waste. Think about how much energy and money you'll waste solving your partnership issues.

Here are the criteria I recommend:

* _super-competent_ in the field of your interest - other competencies are nice to have but should not dismiss a weakness in the field of your interest
* available, i.e. willing to invest time in your venture. You should make sure that they truly are committed to your venture. There are many _yes-I'm-in _guys out there...
* hard working and willing to share the full burden with the team, i.e. also take their share of boring work. On top of that, willing to distribute the shares of the venture according to their contribution rather than a pre-defined percentage (every potential team member should read_Slicing Pie_ by Mike Moyer before joining the team, and sign a Grunt Fund Agreement).
* complementary. That is the toughest one, as we all tend to like people like us. Diversity is critical. Even if they say it is, large corporations tend to hire and grow clones. In a startup, you don't have any choice. You need all kind of competencies from procurement to human resources in your team.

And one very important thing to remember: choose all your partners, not only the founders but also employees and investors. They must bring much more than workforce or cash to your venture.
