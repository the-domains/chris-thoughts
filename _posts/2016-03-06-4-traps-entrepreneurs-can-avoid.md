9 startups out of 10 fails. According to stats in the US, 50% companies don't last more than 5 years. In Europe, from Eurostar data, one gets a failure rate of 25-33% within the 2 first years. Why such a discrepancy? Well, not all startups get incorporated. Many aborts even before reaching that point.

9 startups out of 10 fails. According to stats in the US, 50% companies don't last more than 5 years. In Europe, from Eurostar data, one gets a failure rate of 25-33% within the 2 first years. Why such a discrepancy? Well, not all startups get incorporated. Many aborts even before reaching that point.

Worrying.

The good news is that the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and kicking even in Europe with 10% new companies every single year.Wow2000000+ new companies. Annually. So much more, as aborted startups before incorporation are not accounted for in the stats.

Why do so many of them fail?

Cash is the most commonly cited issue you'll get. But as Jerry Colonna so well say most cash issue come from deeper issues. Here are 4 root causes that contribute to startup failures. Heavily.

Common mistakes:  
1\. [Choosing the wrong/bad partners][0]  
2\. [Taking persistence for resilience][1]  
3\. [Hunting capital way too early][2]  
4\. [Being too much - or not enough - of you][3]
