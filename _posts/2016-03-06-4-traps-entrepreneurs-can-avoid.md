9 startups out of 10 fails. According to stats in the US, 50% companies don't last more than 5 years. In Europe, from Eurostar data, one gets a failure rate of 25-33% within the 2 first years. Why such a discrepancy? Well, not all startups get incorporated. Many aborts even before reaching that point.

9 startups out of 10 fails. According to stats in the US, 50% companies don't last more than 5 years. In Europe, from Eurostar data, one gets a failure rate of 25-33% within the 2 first years. Why such a discrepancy? Well, not all startups get incorporated. Many aborts even before reaching that point.

Worrying.

The good news is that the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and kicking even in Europe with 10% new companies every single year.Wow2000000+ new companies. Annually. So much more, as aborted startups before incorporation are not accounted for in the stats.

Why do so many of them fail?

Cash is the most commonly cited issue you'll get. But as Jerry Colonna so well say most cash issue come from deeper issues. Here are 4 root causes that contribute to startup failures. Heavily.

1\. [Choosing the wrong/bad partners][0]  
2\. [Taking persistence for resilience][1]  
3\. [Hunting capital way too early][2]  
4\. [Being too much - or not enough - of you][3]

These are the most common traps. And yet so many startups fail for precisely one or more of these reasons. I do understand. Really. To be honest, I'm developing an idea with my brother-in-law. So far so good. So we fail because we intrinsically believe that we will manage to circumvent these. I do believe it. I'll let you know what will happen. I promise.

In the meantime, keep these 5 recommendations in mind at all time:

1. **Take your time to choose your partners.** The order of magnitude is 3-6 months.
2. **Get out to sell your product/service even before finished.**
3. **Make sure your customers finance your business.**
4. **Carefully choose your investors and only when truly needed.**If your business is already successful, they'll come to you anyway.
5. **Don't be a jerk!**Life is too short to waste.
