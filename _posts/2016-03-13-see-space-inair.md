# See Space InAir

I found the concept great. I tested it. It doesn't work in concert with the broadcast in Belgium though. And it introduces a lag between video and audio (on my system). And never will boom considering the InAir.tv and SeeSpace websites are down. I didn't find what these guys became. A pity because the concept is still great.
