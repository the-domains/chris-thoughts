# Hunting capital way too early

## \#3 mistake leading to start-up failure
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bc55d89e-9c62-4f02-82a8-5ddf0f66b74a.jpg)

According to stats compiled by Josh Lerner from Thomson/Reuter data on US venture capitalists, 30% VCs have a negative return whereas approximately 10% deliver a decent return (25% p.a). Yeah, some get more than 500% return per annum. But imagine what happens to this return if they had not the Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc. in their portfolio?

Don't hunt capital too early because:  
-- Too much money makes you lazy. And once you get the virus, you'll start chasing money again and again. Is it your core business? Are you money hunter? I don't think so. Don't get distracted from serving your customers.  
-- Being committed to a plan makes you fragile. Investors will expect you to deliver according to the plan. Again the only thing we know about a plan is that it is the only thing that will never happen as such. Being agile, being able to choose rapidly following another path is instrumental to the success of a startup. How many of them started to sell product A to end up selling service B? Many. Most of the successful ones.  
-- Getting advices... Please. Come one. Think about the stats. Do you really want to take a chance to get advices from them?

THAT SAID, when speed matters to beat competition, they can help you with a pile of cash of some advices though.
